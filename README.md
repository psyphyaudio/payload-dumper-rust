# payload-dumper-rust
Android OTA payload dumper written in Rust.

### What is Payload?

-  Android payload is a file that contains ROM partitions like boot , system, vendor . and others. Payload Dumper extracts these partitions from the payload.bin file

## features
- Extracts all or individual images directly from payload.bin or ROM ZIP file.

- Supports extracting individual partitions from URLs without downloading the full ROM ZIP.

- All decompression processes run in parallel for improved performance. ( can be customised by using`--no-parallel` or `--threads <n>` as argument )

---
- Output partitions Verification ✅
- Parallel Extraction ✅
- Selective Partition Extraction ✅
- Direct Extraction from URL ✅
<!--
- Incremental OTA support ❓ ( not tested )
-->
---

## How To Use 
- Download Binaries for your respective Platform from [releases section](https://github.com/rhythmcache/payload-dumper-rust/releases)
- If you are using a rooted android device you might want to install it as a [magisk module](https://github.com/rhythmcache/payload-dumper-rust/releases/download/0.3.0/payload_dumper-android-magisk-module.zip)

- or Run this in termux / Linux Terminal to install 
  ```
  bash <(curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhythmcache/payload-dumper-rust/main/scripts/install.sh")
  ```
- To install on windows, run this in Powershell
```
powershell -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhythmcache/payload-dumper-rust/main/scripts/install.ps1' | Invoke-Expression"
```

### Install via Cargo

If you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can install this tool with:

```bash
cargo install payload_dumper
```
<!--
Note - Installation VIA Cargo might fail if you dont have `protobuf-compiler`, `libzip`, `zlib` and `liblzma` installed on your system

## *Performance Metrics** 

- Here are the performance metrics for **Payload Dumper Rust** running on a **Poco X4 Pro (SD695, 8GB RAM)** in Termux. The test file used is [comet-ota-ad1a.240530.030-98066022.zip](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/comet-ota-ad1a.240530.030-98066022.zip) (2.53GB).

| **Extraction Method**       | **Time Taken**       | **Notes**                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Direct Payload Extraction** | **2 minutes 26 seconds** | Extracting directly from `payload.bin`. |
| **ZIP File Extraction**      | **2 minutes 30 seconds** | Extracting directly from the ZIP file. |
| **Remote URL Extraction**    | **Slower**           | Depends on network speed.          |

### Usage :
#### Basic Usage

To extract partitions from a payload file, run the following command:

```bash
payload_dumper <path/to/payload.bin> --out output_directory
```
#### Direct ZIP Processing

it can directly process payloads from ZIP files without requiring manual extraction. Simply provide the path to the ZIP file:

```bash
./payload_dumper <path/to/ota.zip> --out <output_directory>
```

#### Remote Payloads

it can also handle payloads/zips directly using url.  Simply provide the URL as path. this is very slow compared to local 
extraction though.

```bash
./payload_dumper https://example.com/payload.bin
```
#### Individual partitions extraction.

- to extract individual partitions from payloads/URL/zips , use `--images` and enter the name of partitions you want to extract comma-separated.
- 
for example to just extract `boot` and `vendor_boot` from `url/zip/payload` , simply run

```
payload_dumper --images boot,vendor_boot <https://example.com/zip>
```
